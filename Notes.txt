Heart arrhythmia, also known as irregular heartbeat or cardiac dysrhythmia, is a group of conditions where the heartbeat is irregular, too slow, or too fast.
Arrhythmias are broken down into:
->Slow heartbeat: bradycardia.
->Fast heartbeat: tachycardia.
->Irregular heartbeat: flutter or fibrillation.
->Early heartbeat: premature contraction.
Symptoms:-
Many arrhythmias cause no symptoms at all, so you may not even know you have one until your doctor tells you.
Having symptoms doesn't necessarily mean that you're in any danger from the arrhythmia either.
Despite the fact that there are many different kinds, the noticeable symptoms caused by arrhythmias generally fall into four major categories, including:
->Palpitations
->Dizziness
->Syncope (fainting)
->Cardiac arrest
Depending on the type and severity of your arrhythmia, you may notice symptoms such as sweating,
feeling like your heart is racing or fluttering, noticing extra heartbeats, feeling your heartbeat has slowed, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
